# Industrial-equipment-classification
A machine learning model for classifying industrial equipment images as 'Defective' or 'Non-Defective' using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model employs image preprocessing and augmentation for improved performance, with evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
